## Basic understanding
Git allows you to keep multiple versions of the same codebase in the same place.

Git allows you to keep a log of the changes you make to your project code as well as move it to multiple computers.

When you start working with other people or working on the same project through multiple versions,
you will want to know when you broke something in your code and what the working code looked like.




## Main commands you will need to know
        git remote add origin user@domain.tld:some-remote-org/some-remote-proejct
        git pull some-remote branch-name
        git branch new-branch-name
        git checkout new-branch-name
        git add *
        git commit -m "Some list of what you did in the commited code"
        git push some-remote branch-name
        git merge some-other-branch
